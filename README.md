# algebra

This Project is intended to create a simple way of re-arranging equations using the algebraic method with drag and drop functionality of javascript and HTML5.

***This project is in its infancy***

## How it does/will work?

The objective of this project is to create a software that is capable of creating an equation, then dragging-and-dropping variables from one end to the equation to the next and still maintain equality.

## How it will be built

I don't yet know. There was once a time in which I did, but now I have forgotten.

## Distribution

I intent for this to be forever a free software, in all senses of the word.

## Help

If anyone is interested in developing this to help humanity, please contact me.
